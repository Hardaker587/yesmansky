_"Yes Man's Sky"_ is a webgl tech demo that explores how to use simple procedural generation techniques to generate 3d planets. It's inspired by [a game of similar name](https://www.nomanssky.com/).

The demo was developed using [babylonsJS](https://babylonjs.com), Vue and typescript.

It features dynamic level of detail for the planets, mouse/touch controls and a set of parameters to generate different kind of planets. :)
